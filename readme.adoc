This solution try to address how to access an AWS S3 bucket, with SSE-KMS encryption, from an Azure function.

.Azure cloud resources access AWS resources with temporary security credentials

This project provides:

1. the terraform scripts to build basic Azure infrastructure

2. the bash script to link:./scripts/app.roles.assignments.sh[assign managed identity to application]

3. the link:./fnc-lab-aws-sso/function_app.py[Azure function] that, after assume role with web identity, access to the encrypted S3 and read blobs

4. link:./.github/workflows/main_fnc-lab-aws-sso.yml[GitHub action] to build and deploy the Azure function (with Github federation too :smiley:)
